category: HTTP Status User Error
name: 428 Precondition Required
description: |
  The origin server requires the request to be conditional. 
  Intended to prevent the *lost update* problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, 
  and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, 
  leading to a conflict.
